<b>You are only going to give a shit about the 'A's.</b> <br /><br />

* A = <b>Takes you closer to your big goal(s).</b>
Only you can do it. It's business critical, time bound/urgent, potentially 'life-changing' - in other words, important shit that actually matters! Must be done within 2-3 weeks.

* B = <b>Still important, but could perhaps be handled by someone else</b>, follow up with you, or - alternatively - someone needs to be contacted or delegated to relatively soon.

* C = <b>Not urgent</b> or time bound, would like to be done 'sometime' but if it doesn't happen isn't the end of the world."></pro-tip>
