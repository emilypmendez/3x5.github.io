Boring? Au contraire...

This app helps you do 3 very important things.

* FOCUS: make more money
* ORGANIZE: it's totally automated
* PRIORITIZE: the never ending todolist is now obsolete

You'll finally get back a few more hours every week...

You'll be able to SLEEP well because your shit is getting done CONSISTENTLY...

AND earning $$$ all the meanwhile. Perhaps more than usual if done right?

Just remember... this app doesn't work unless you do. ;-)


# What does this app *do* for *me*?
Most productive people try to organize their lives, businesses, and personal routines by jotting them down on paper...
These are other folks who also have a tendency to keep record of their agendas over time...

Could be on paper, mobile app (where you write and save a virtual version of the paper checklist), right?
OK, well typically our todo lists have HUNDREDS of items - and that's overwhelming AF.

# Now Wait Just a Damn Minute... #

Doesn't this prep take a stupidly-large block of time and concentration JUST to organize this week? Month, Year???

** And *how* do You *keep track* of your progress across the week? Do you even #analyze#, bro? **

We have a vision for organizing your entire life in such a way that fits YOUR lifestyle.


======================


# Get shit done in minutes, not hours. #

No pressure.
No distractions.
No BULLSHIT!

You can even call it.. the "GetShitDone" lifestyle. :-)

What? Too shameless? (#sorrynotsorry...)

Anyway, we hope you like this beta version.
