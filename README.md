======================

# The Basics About GSD
Based on the 21st century 'Meredith Method' -  where business owners, freelancers, and independent contractors receive world class business coaching, support, and strategies for business and personal growth.

Boring? Au contraire...

This app helps you do 3 very important things.

* FOCUS: make more money
* ORGANIZE: it's totally automated
* PRIORITIZE: the never ending todolist is now obsolete

You'll finally get back a few more hours every week...

You'll be able to SLEEP well because your shit is getting done CONSISTENTLY...

AND earning $$$ all the meanwhile. Perhaps more than usual if done right?

Just remember... this app doesn't work unless you do. ;-)


# What does this app *do* for *me*?
Most productive people try to organize their lives, businesses, and personal routines by jotting them down on paper...
These are other folks who also have a tendency to keep record of their agendas over time...

Could be on paper, mobile app (where you write and save a virtual version of the paper checklist), right?
OK, well typically our todo lists have HUNDREDS of items - and that's overwhelming AF.

# Now Wait Just a Damn Minute... #

Doesn't this prep take a stupidly-large block of time and concentration JUST to organize this week? Month, Year???

** And *how* do You *keep track* of your progress across the week? Do you even #analyze#, bro? **

We have a vision for organizing your entire life in such a way that fits YOUR lifestyle.


======================


# Get shit done in minutes, not hours. #

No pressure.
No distractions.
No BULLSHIT!

You can even call it.. the "GetShitDone" lifestyle. :-)

What? Too shameless? (#sorrynotsorry...)

Anyway, we hope you like this beta version.

# Jekyll CV Crafter
This website was made by the Jekyll CV Crafter theme
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jekyll-cv-crafter.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jekyll-cv-crafter)

Jekyll powered CV generator. Check the [demo](http://pavelmakhov.com/jekyll-cv-crafter/).

## Features
 - Lightweight - just 3 files: yml with information about you, html/liquid template and css.
 - Font Awesome icons + Bootstrap.
 - Could be easily integrated in already existing site/blog hosted on Github using Jekyll [data](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/) files.
 - Data is separated from the view - just fill the YAML file to create your CV.
 - You can easily modify the template or create a new theme according to your needs.

## Installation
Clone/download this repo.
 - `_data/cv.yml` contains info about you;
 - `index.html` markup of the CV;
 - `css/cv.scss` styles.

So only thing you need to do is to fill the `cv.yml`.
As I mentioned above you can easily integrate this CV in your blog (if it's hosted on github pages) by putting `cv.yml` in `_data` folder of your blog, `cv.scss` in `css` folder of your blog and renaming `index.html` to `cv.html`.

PRs/issues/comments are welcome! Don't hesitate to contact me in case of any questions.
